This is a repository to hold the game projects I am working on as I learn game development, feel free to download and let me know if you enjoy it at all, and if you have any suggestions they would be appreciated.

As i am starting from scratch with almost no knowledge of coding and game development, i am starting from old school atari type games and working my way forward.
